## My process
Series of little steps which started by putting basic html followed by vue functionalities 
I had to figure out how to toggle between divs using a function followed by dynamic classes to 
identify the divs while toggling and also the type of transitioning I wanted.
I then focused on styling based on the example given and made it responsive using @media .

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- @media
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### Continued development

I want to seek other projects to further polish the skills I have been learning
